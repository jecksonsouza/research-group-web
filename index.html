        Hi! I am a Msc in computer science and currently a Phd student in computer science with focus on embedded systems at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil. <br>
        My current research areas include multicore heterogeneous systems, reconfigurable architectures and approximate computing. <br>
        I also have a BSC in Computer Engineering at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul and I did an undergraduated sandwich program in Electronic & Software Engineering at the University of Glasgow, in Scotland (2013).
